  <p  id="info1">
    Messi started playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the youth team of Newell’s Old Boys
    (a Rosario-based top-division football club).
    Messi’s phenomenal skills garnered the attention of prestigious clubs on both sides of the Atlantic.
    At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began playing for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in
   14 games for the junior team, and he quickly graduated through the higher-level teams until at
    age 16 he was given his informal debut with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.

In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal
scorer in the Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest division of football).
 Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 metres) tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), he was strong,
 well-balanced, and versatile on the field. Naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball,
  Messi was a keen pass distributor and could readily thread his way through packed defenses. In 2005 he was granted Spanish citizenship,
   an honour greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona. The next year Messi and Barcelona won
    the Champions League (the European club championship) title.
